Statistical Analysis


Participant Exclusion:

-German non native (complete participant)
-knows pragmatics (complete participant)
-knows logic (complete participant)
->do not exclude when there is an NA for logic/pragmatics/native speaker
-answers 3 or more fillers wrong (complete participant)
-test items that are responded too fast, use threshold (exclude only test item, not whole participant)

p = antecedent, q = consequent

question was either of the type what-if-p or when-q
answer to either question was a conditional of the form “If p, q”


"Conditional Perfection occurs significantly more often if the antecedent of the conditional is focused compared to the non-focused case"
=> In the TVJT we always deal with the focused case, and never with non-focused?? 
   Or is focus on antecedent = focused case while focus on consequent ist non-focus case?

"If focus influences CP we expect that subjects rate the conditional answer more often as insufficient in the when-q condition than in the what-if-p condition." (p.233)

what-if-p: focus on consequent (non-focus case) -> "What if I sell an eel?"
when-q	 : focus on antecedent (focused case) -> "When do I get 2.50 Euros?"
answer	 : 		       -> "If you sell an eel you get 2.50 Euros."
CP = assuming: "only if person sells an eel, they get 2.50 Euros."

TVJT: True or False (negative or positive)

when-q -> false (as only one possibility was given) -> signals CP : 56.6%
what-if-p -> false -> signals CP : 11.1%

=> What does it mean to to look at an effect over subjects and over items?
"The effect was again significant over subjects, F(1,32) = 58.175, p < 0.001, as well as over items, F(1,5) = 50.845, p < 0.001."

Logistic Regression
-------------------

We want to know whether or not the focus (i.e. the question type what-if/when-q) influences the rise of the CP (i.e. answering with "false")

Independent var (categorical)	: when-q (focus) or what-if (non-focus)
Dependent/Response var (binary in logReg): answer of "true" or "false" in test item -> false = CP arises; true = CP does not arise
